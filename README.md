# Groebner-Calls-in-SymPy-Test-Suite
This repository contains a dataset of all Groebner basis computations triggered during the execution of the SymPy test suite.  Putting this out here in case it might be useful for optimizing Groebner Basis computation in the SymPy codebase.

Refer to the discussion in the PR: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/27459 for context.
